        "icon": "\U0001f9e0",
        "what": (
            "This tab provides three neuroimaging-specific analysis tools. "
            "(1) Coordinate Extraction scans your full-text articles for "
            "brain activation coordinates reported in MNI or Talairach "
            "space\u2014using regex-based table parsing\u2014and exports them in "
            "NiMARE, GingerALE/Sleuth, or CSV format for downstream "
            "coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA). (2) NeuroQuery "
            "Cross-Reference queries the NeuroQuery predictive engine "
            "with each hypothesis component\u2019s keywords and compares the "
            "predicted activation map against the brain regions actually "
            "observed in your extracted claims, producing a convergence "
            "score. (3) Network Visualization renders an interactive "
            "force-directed graph of condition\u2013brain-region co-occurrence "
            "patterns extracted from the evidence corpus."
        ),
        "why": (
            "Text-based systematic reviews capture \u2018what regions are "
            "mentioned\u2019 but lose spatial precision. Coordinate-based "
            "meta-analysis (ALE, MKDA) leverages the exact stereotaxic "
            "locations reported in fMRI/PET studies to test whether "
            "activation peaks converge beyond chance. Exporting your "
            "corpus coordinates into standard CBMA formats bridges the "
            "gap between narrative synthesis and spatial statistics. "
            "The NeuroQuery convergence check adds an independent, "
            "data-driven prior: if the literature consistently implicates "
            "regions that NeuroQuery also predicts for your hypothesis "
            "terms, confidence in the spatial claim increases. The "
            "network graph visualises which configured constructs or "
            "populations share brain-region mentions, revealing hub regions "
            "and potential cross-domain pathway overlaps."

            "JSON (for Python-based CBMA), GingerALE Sleuth format "

            "shows a convergence table with one row per hypothesis "

            "NeuroQuery-predicted regions that were actually observed "
            "in your corpus. Scores above 0.3 suggest meaningful spatial "
            "agreement. Select a row to see the matched, predicted-only, "
            "and observed-only region lists. The network graph colours "
